# Pseudocode for Calculating x^y

## Declare variables
- Declare `x` as double (base number)
- Declare `y` as double (exponent)
- Declare `result` as double

## Read input values from the user
- Prompt user to enter `x`
- Read `x` from input
- Prompt user to enter `y`
- Read `y` from input

## Calculate the power
- Set `result` to `pow(x, y)`

## Output the result
- Print "The result of x^y is `result`"
