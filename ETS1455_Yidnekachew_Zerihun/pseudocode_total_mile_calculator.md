# Pseudocode for Calculating Driving Range Without Refueling

## Declare variables
- Declare `tank_capacity` as double
- Declare `miles_per_gallon` as double
- Declare `total_miles` as double

## Read input values from the user
- Prompt user to enter `tank_capacity` in gallons
- Read `tank_capacity` from input
- Prompt user to enter `miles_per_gallon`
- Read `miles_per_gallon` from input

## Calculate total miles
- Calculate `total_miles` as `tank_capacity` multiplied by `miles_per_gallon`

## Output the result
- Print "The automobile can be driven `total_miles` miles without refueling."
