# Pseudocode for Calculating Transmission Time
1.start
2. Declare variables
     - Declare `file_size` as double
- Declare `transmission_rate` as double, initialize to 960 (characters per second)
- Declare `transmission_time` as double

3. Read file size from user
- Prompt user to enter the file size in bytes
- Read `file_size` from input
  
4. Calculate time in seconds:
   - time_in_seconds = file_size / transmission_speed

5. Output the result
- Print "The transmission time is `transmission_time` seconds."

6. Convert seconds to days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Calculate `days` as `transmission_time` divided by (24 * 3600)
- Subtract `days * 24 * 3600` from `transmission_time`
- Calculate `hours` as `transmission_time` divided by 3600
- Subtract `hours * 3600` from `transmission_time`
- Calculate `minutes` as `transmission_time` divided by 60
- Subtract `minutes * 60` from `transmission_time`
- Remaining `transmission_time` is `seconds`

7. Output the converted result
- Print "Which is approximately `days` days, `hours` hours, `minutes` minutes, and `seconds` seconds."
