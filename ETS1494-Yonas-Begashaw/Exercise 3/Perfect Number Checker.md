# Problem Analysis   
**Input:** A number.  
**Output:** Result.

# Operation:   
- Variable declaration that holds an input and operation results.
- Intitialize a variable sum to 0 and a variable i to 1.
- Check if i is a factor of the number.
- If i is a factor, update sum: sum = sum + i.
- Update i: i = i + 1.
- If i <= number go to step 3.
- If sum - number = number, display "The number is a perfect number."
- If sum - number not equal to number, display "The number isn't a perfect number."
