@Problem Analysis
1.	Input
    o	The value  of x from the user
    o	The value of y from the user
    o	Repeat calculation: option to continue or terminate (1 for yes, 0 for no)
2.	Output
    o	X raised to the power of y : pow(x, y)
    o	Error messages for invalid inputs from the user
3.	Process/Operation
    o	Variable declaration- result for result of pow(x, y), choice for choosing, x and y for input value
    o	Initialization counter to zero
    o	Loop to validate x and y input values, allowing a maximum of 3 attempts
    o	If they are valid find the result (calculate x the power of y)
    o	Use result = pow(x, y), to calculate x the power of y
    o	Display the final result
    o	Ask the user if they want to calculate again or exit
    o	Handle invalid inputs and prompt for re-entry where necessary.
