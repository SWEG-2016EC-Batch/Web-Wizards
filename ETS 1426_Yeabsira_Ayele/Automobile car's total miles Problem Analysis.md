Problem Analysis
1.	Input 
   	fuel tank caacity in gallons
   	fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
   	user option to continue or terminate the program
2.	output
  	display the total miles that can be driven without refueling
  	eror and warning messages for invalid input and remaing attempts
  	termination message after the program ends
3.	pprocess/ 
  	declare variables for fuel tank capacity, miles per gallon, total miles
  	initialize variables such as counter, temp, again for control 
  	ask the user to input fuel tank capacity in gallons.
     o	If the input is invalid, give the user 3 attempts
     o	If all attempts fail, terminate the program
  	Prompt the user to input the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
    o	If the input is invalid, give the user 3 attempts
    o	If all attempts fail, terminate the program
  	Calculate total miles using the formula:  
      Total miles= fuel tank capacity in gallons * fuel efficiency
  	Display the total miles
  	Use loop to calculate again for another car
  	Ask the user if s/he want to calculate for another car
  	If yes, repeat the process
       If no, terminate the program
